- tty.js:
  - backend running shell (tumx)
  - frontend in browser
    - hack to add support for narrative control codes:
      - music
      - sound
      - glitching?
- each host is a docker container
  - flat network i guess? (IPv6? probably too much trouble)
- build runs packer to create a vagrant image
  - or an AMI or something for remote-hosted games (sandstorm?)
- vagrant up yields port 8022 to shell account machine ("con"?)
- should have realistic dns (can docker's dns do FQDNs?)
- repo layout:
  - r00tme: super project
    - design: this repo, with design notes
    - "con": the user's console system
    - systems: directories of Dockerfiles and supporting stuff
      - this is narratively pluggable part
